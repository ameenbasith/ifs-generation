# IFS Website
A website that will allow both client side and server side generation of images produced by iterative function systems.

## Iterative Function Systems(IFS)
An IFS is a system of functions that can be used to transform a point by picking one at random and using it to tansform the point. 

If you do this enough times, the point will convergere towards an image or diverge.

## The Problem
I was requested to spruce up the front-end.

I could possibly change the color scheme to more black and white, revisit this idea at a later time
