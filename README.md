# IFS Website
# Iterative Function Systems(IFS)
===============

A website that will allow both client side and server side generation of images produced by iterative function systems.
An IFS is a system of functions that can be used to transform a point by picking one at random and using it to tansform the point. 
If you do this enough times, the point will convergere towards an image or diverge.
